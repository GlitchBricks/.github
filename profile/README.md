# GlitchBricks

GlitchBricks playground platform for creative manipulation of analog A/V signals. It's primary goal is to make circuit bending accessible, modular, and (optionally) programmable.

## Overview

The GlitchBricks platform is built on top of two main pillars:

- The OAVCP control protocol allows centralized control over the entire modular system. This lets rigs be automatable and opens up vast realms of creative possibilities.
- The GlitchBricks communication bus (GBCB) provides the hardware standard over which modules (bricks) can be chained together to combine different creative capabilities.
